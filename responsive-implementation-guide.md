# Responsive Implementation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the responsive layout improvements to the RSI website.

## Quick Start

1. Add the responsive CSS fixes:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="responsive-fixes.css">
   ```
   
   Add this line after your existing style.css link in each HTML file's head section.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Mobile-First Approach

Start by implementing the responsive fixes in `responsive-fixes.css`. These provide immediate improvements without requiring a full redesign.

### 2. Navigation Fixes

The mobile navigation needs attention:

1. Ensure the hamburger menu is properly sized for touch
2. Fix the logo sizing across breakpoints
3. Make buttons stack properly on mobile

### 3. Hero Section

The hero section needs better stacking behavior:

1. On mobile, stack content vertically
2. Reduce the image height
3. Center-align text and buttons
4. Adjust the decorative squares positioning

### 4. Business Units Cards

Fix the business unit cards:

1. Ensure consistent card heights
2. Apply proper spacing between cards
3. Fix image sizing issues
4. Ensure buttons are properly aligned

### 5. Typography System

Implement the responsive typography variables:

1. Set base font sizes for headings and body text
2. Apply scaling based on screen size
3. Ensure readability on all devices

### 6. Testing Protocol

Test your implementation on:

- iPhone SE (Small mobile)
- iPhone 12/13 (Standard mobile)
- iPad/iPad Mini (Small tablet)
- iPad Pro (Large tablet)
- Laptop (1024px width)
- Desktop (1440px width)

Check these specific issues:
- Navigation menu opens and closes correctly
- All buttons are tappable (minimum size 44x44px)
- Text is readable on all devices
- Images display properly and load efficiently
- No horizontal scrolling appears
- No content is cut off

## Advanced Improvements

After implementing the basic fixes, consider these advanced improvements:

### 1. Image Loading Optimization

Update image loading for better performance:

```html
<picture>
  <source 
    type="image/webp" 
    media="(max-width: 575px)"
    srcset="img/logo-small.webp">
  <source 
    type="image/webp" 
    media="(max-width: 991px)"
    srcset="img/logo-medium.webp">
  <source 
    type="image/webp" 
    srcset="img/logo-large.webp">
  <img 
    src="img/logo-large.png" 
    class="img-fluid" 
    alt="Logo"
    loading="lazy"
    width="186" 
    height="44">
</picture>
```

### 2. Performance Testing

Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to test:
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Best Practices
- SEO

Focus particularly on:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

### 3. Touch Target Improvements

Ensure all interactive elements are properly sized:
- Minimum 44x44px touch targets
- Adequate spacing between touch targets (at least 8px)
- Proper hover/active states for touch feedback
